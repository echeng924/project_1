# Fantastic Pong

## Overview
This is my take on the classic Atari arcade game, Pong. 
In this two player version, the first player who reaches 3 points wins the game.

## Approach
My goal was to stay as true to the original game as possible with a few modifications for style. I also incorporated a random increase in speed with each players' successful volley, therefore increasing the difficulty as the game progresses.

## Languages
The game was created using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.

## Updates
I would like to update the game to add in the option of a single player against the computer.  In addition, in this version I haven't factored in the actual physics of the ball and paddle collision.  This is something I hope to update in the future.
